### - Introduction about Tuby:
#### Nearby is a platform to find the best restaurants, hotels, and attractions near your location, Nearby is super fast to display content
#### So when you select any place you can see all information about its like rating, range of price, pictures of the place, information about contact with the place and full address

#### - What I used technologies to build Tuby?
##### The important things I used to create Tuby are (ReactJS v18.2.0, TypeScript 4.9, JavaScript, Material UI v5.11.1, and RapidAPIs)

#### - Setup and using it:
##### To install Tuby to your computer it's easy you can clone it and just type `npm i` to your terminal
Do what you need to add to it or update it or anything you need and update it again
It's so welcomed to work with me to add new features to it
